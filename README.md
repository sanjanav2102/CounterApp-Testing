# Counter App 

I built a basic Counter App which displays the counter value and increments if the add button is clicked and decrements if remove button is clicked.
The core concept learnt here is testing. 
*How can you ensure that your app continues to work as you add more features or change existing functionality? By writing tests.*

## Features Learnt 
- stateful widgets
- Floating Action buttons with icons.
- onPressed function
- unitary and multiple testing (test, group, except)

## Screenshots
